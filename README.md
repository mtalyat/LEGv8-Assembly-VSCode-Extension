LEGv8 Assembly Extension for Visual Studio Code
======

This is a LEGv8 Assembly extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension provides some basic functionality, including, but not limited to: syntax highlighting, autocomplete options, and the ability to simulate a small environment for the assembly to run. 

LEGv8 itself is a subset of the ARM assembly architecture. LEG is not used in real applications- it is used merely to be a teaching tool to help make the learning process easier in regards to assembly. The goal of this repository, and this extension, is to help in those efforts to those who are interested in learning assembly.

## Features

The LEGv8 Assembly extension has the following features:
* Syntax highlighting.
* Autocomplete/autofill options for all of the implemented instructions.
* A mock debugger that will run through and evaluate the assembly code.
* Ability to configure the simulation within settings.

To see a list of all instructions and features implemented within the simulation, check out the wiki tab.

## Known Issues

Many things from LEG have not been fully implemented or tested. Those things are as follows:
* Overflow and carry flag setting/comparisons
* Floating point instructions
* Arithmetic instructions

If you find any new issues, please create an issue for them on the [Github repository](https://github.com/mtalyat/LEGv8-Assembly-VSCode-Extension).
