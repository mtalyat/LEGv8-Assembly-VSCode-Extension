LEGv8 Assembly Extension for Visual Studio Code
======

This is a LEGv8 Assembly extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension provides some basic functionality, including, but not limited to: syntax highlighting, autocomplete options, and the ability to simulate a small environment for the assembly to run. 

LEGv8 itself is a subset of the ARM assembly architecture. LEG is not used in real applications- it is used merely to be a teaching tool to help make the learning process easier in regards to assembly. The goal of this repository, and this extension, is to help in those efforts to those who are interested in learning assembly.
